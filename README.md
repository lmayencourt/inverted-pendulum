# Inverted pendulum

This repo contains the code for an inverted pendulum simulation.
The goal is to play with Rust simulation (bevy, rapier), graphics (egui) and machine-learning libraries.

## Requirements overview
Essential features are:
 - The program display an interactive pendulum simulation, with graphs info about position and speed of the pendulum.
 - The pendulum simulator can be played by a human player, or by an AI agent.
 - The AI agent can be trained on the same software.
